# CLAUDE.md

Personal life planner. Single user, built for someone with ADHD and possible depression. Read this fully at the start of every session.

Full spec: `docs/spec.md` · Design tokens: `docs/design-system.md`

## The thing to understand first

The hard part of this project is not the features. It's that the app has to stay openable on a bad week. A technically correct planner that feels like a chore is a failed planner, and the failure is silent — it just stops getting opened one day and never gets opened again.

So when a tradeoff comes up between "more capable" and "less friction," take less friction. Every time.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Default view is Today.** Opening the app answers "what do I do right now" in under two seconds with no navigation.
2. **Minimum required fields at capture.** Every mandatory field is a chance for the thought to evaporate before it's recorded. If a field can be optional, it is.
3. **No streak-shaming.** No streak counters, no broken-streak states, no guilt copy, no "you missed 3 days." Missed days appear neutrally and are trivially back-fillable. This rule has been violated by well-meaning refactors before — check yourself against it whenever you add a history or stats view.
4. **No pure red in the UI.** Overdue is `--t-overdue` (clay rose). See the colour law below.
5. **Never silently lose data.** Optimistic UI is fine; a failed sync must be visible and recoverable.
6. **Never silently write.** AI-parsed food, AI-extracted syllabus dates, and chatbot actions are all shown for confirmation before they touch the database.
7. **Local time is `America/Toronto`.** A "day" is the user's local day, never UTC. Must survive DST.

## Copy voice

Plain, active, sentence case. Errors say what happened and what to do, and don't apologize. Empty states are neutral or an invitation — never praise, never a lament. No emoji. No exclamation marks.

## The colour law

Three systems want colour, and they are separated by temperature. Do not blur them.

- **Time / urgency** — warm earth ramp. Edge bars, text, icon tint.
- **Macros** — cool jewel tones. Ring strokes only.
- **Courses** — desaturated pastels. 3px left edge or 6px dot only, never a fill.

Macro colours never appear on a task. Urgency colours never appear on a ring.

**No colour value may be written anywhere except `tokens.css`.** No hex codes in components, no arbitrary Tailwind values like `bg-[#1D1F28]`. If a colour is needed that doesn't exist, propose adding it to the token file and say why — don't inline it. This single rule is what keeps a seven-phase build from looking like seven apps.

**Colour is never the only signal.** Every urgency state carries a text label; every ring carries a written value.

## Scope — do not add these

Full note-taking · gamification, points, levels, badges · workout tracking · personal finances.

If asked to add one mid-build, push back and say why before complying. Scope creep is the most likely cause of this project never shipping.

## Working agreement

- Build in phases, in order. Ship one phase working end-to-end before starting the next.
- Complete files. Never `// ... rest unchanged`.
- After each phase: what changed, what I need to do (accounts, keys, commands), **what is not yet working**, and the suggested next step.
- Prefer boring, well-understood dependencies. Every dependency is a thing that can break at 2am when the app is the only thing holding the week together.
- If something in the spec is ambiguous or looks wrong, say so before building it.
- Don't optimize prematurely. One user, a few thousand rows.

## Stack

React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind, PWA · Supabase (Postgres, auth, RLS, edge functions) · Cloudflare Pages or Vercel · scheduled edge function for the 07:00 digest · one swappable LLM module shared by the diet parser and the chatbot · USDA FoodData Central + Open Food Facts.

Free tiers only, permanently. If something can't be done free, say so rather than assuming a paid tier.

## Conventions

- Dates: store UTC timestamps, render in `America/Toronto`, compute "today" from local date.
- Money-like precision for macros: store grams as numeric, don't accumulate float error across a day.
- Changing a macro target must never retroactively alter historical days — targets are versioned by effective date.
- AI-estimated entries carry an `is_estimate` flag and render visually distinct from exact ones.
- Every table has RLS enabled. Data must not be publicly readable.

## Current status

Phase: **0 — foundation + push proof. DONE**, verified 17 Aug 2026.

The gate is met. A scheduled server job delivered a real notification to the phone. Verified in production, not inferred:

- `cron.job_run_details` — the 15-minute job fires and succeeds.
- `net._http_response` — pg_net reaches the edge function, HTTP 200.
- The scheduled branch produced `sent: true` via Telegram with a real digest row (`"Mon, Aug 17" / "Nothing due."`), by temporarily moving the digest time to the current minute. Settings were restored and the forced row deleted afterwards.

117 tests, clean build, clean `deno check`. `npm run check` runs all three.

**Still open from Phase 0**, neither of which blocks Phase 1:

- **Not deployed.** `APP_URL` is still `http://localhost:5173`, so notification deep links are dead on the phone. Deployment is also a hard prerequisite for the Web Push soak — iOS only permits push for a PWA installed to the home screen over HTTPS.
- **The 7-day pause theory is untested.** Confirm around 24 Aug that the project is still awake.

Deliberate Phase 0 scope decisions, so they are not mistaken for gaps:

- **No feature tables.** Assignments, events, courses and the checklist are Phase 1. The digest builder correctly returns the empty digest ("Nothing due.") — which is a real specified code path, not a placeholder, and it is the branch hardest to notice being broken.
- **The offline outbox is the mechanism only**, exercised on one write type. Phase 1 routes its writes through it unchanged.
- **Web Push is written and unit-tested but unproven.** It is priority 20, below Telegram at 10. Promote it to 10 only after the 5-day soak; if it drops two days, leave Telegram primary and move on.

Three tokens deviate from `docs/design-system.md` to satisfy its own contrast floor. Each is documented inline in `tokens.css` with its measurement. Revert if you disagree.

Design system: **built** (Phase 0.5). Eight primitives, specimen page at `/?specimen` in dev.

_Update this section at the end of every phase._
