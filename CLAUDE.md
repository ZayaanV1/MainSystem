# CLAUDE.md

Personal life planner. Single user, built for someone with ADHD and possible depression. Read this fully at the start of every session.

Full spec: `docs/spec.md` · Design tokens: `docs/design-system.md`

## The thing to understand first

The hard part of this project is not the features. It's that the app has to stay openable on a bad week. A technically correct planner that feels like a chore is a failed planner, and the failure is silent — it just stops getting opened one day and never gets opened again.

So when a tradeoff comes up between "more capable" and "less friction," take less friction. Every time.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Default view is Today.** Opening the app answers "what do I do right now" in under two seconds with no navigation.
2. **Minimum required fields at capture.** Every mandatory field is a chance for the thought to evaporate before it's recorded. If a field can be optional, it is.
3. **No streak-shaming.** No streak counters, no broken-streak states, no guilt copy, no "you missed 3 days." Missed days appear neutrally and are trivially back-fillable. This rule has been violated by well-meaning refactors before — check yourself against it whenever you add a history or stats view.
4. **No pure red in the UI.** Overdue is `--t-overdue` (clay rose). See the colour law below.
5. **Never silently lose data.** Optimistic UI is fine; a failed sync must be visible and recoverable.
6. **Never silently write.** AI-parsed food, AI-extracted syllabus dates, and chatbot actions are all shown for confirmation before they touch the database.
7. **Local time is `America/Toronto`.** A "day" is the user's local day, never UTC. Must survive DST.

## Copy voice

Plain, active, sentence case. Errors say what happened and what to do, and don't apologize. Empty states are neutral or an invitation — never praise, never a lament. No emoji. No exclamation marks.

## The colour law

Three systems want colour, and they are separated by temperature. Do not blur them.

- **Time / urgency** — warm earth ramp. Edge bars, text, icon tint.
- **Macros** — cool jewel tones. Ring strokes only.
- **Courses** — desaturated pastels. 3px left edge or 6px dot only, never a fill.

Macro colours never appear on a task. Urgency colours never appear on a ring.

**No colour value may be written anywhere except `tokens.css`.** No hex codes in components, no arbitrary Tailwind values like `bg-[#1D1F28]`. If a colour is needed that doesn't exist, propose adding it to the token file and say why — don't inline it. This single rule is what keeps a seven-phase build from looking like seven apps.

**Colour is never the only signal.** Every urgency state carries a text label; every ring carries a written value.

## Scope — do not add these

Full note-taking · gamification, points, levels, badges · workout tracking · personal finances.

If asked to add one mid-build, push back and say why before complying. Scope creep is the most likely cause of this project never shipping.

## Working agreement

- Build in phases, in order. Ship one phase working end-to-end before starting the next.
- Complete files. Never `// ... rest unchanged`.
- After each phase: what changed, what I need to do (accounts, keys, commands), **what is not yet working**, and the suggested next step.
- Prefer boring, well-understood dependencies. Every dependency is a thing that can break at 2am when the app is the only thing holding the week together.
- If something in the spec is ambiguous or looks wrong, say so before building it.
- Don't optimize prematurely. One user, a few thousand rows.

## Stack

React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind, PWA · Supabase (Postgres, auth, RLS, edge functions) · Cloudflare Pages or Vercel · scheduled edge function for the 07:00 digest · one swappable LLM module shared by the diet parser and the chatbot · USDA FoodData Central + Open Food Facts.

Free tiers only, permanently. If something can't be done free, say so rather than assuming a paid tier.

## Conventions

- Dates: store UTC timestamps, render in `America/Toronto`, compute "today" from local date.
- Money-like precision for macros: store grams as numeric, don't accumulate float error across a day.
- Changing a macro target must never retroactively alter historical days — targets are versioned by effective date.
- AI-estimated entries carry an `is_estimate` flag and render visually distinct from exact ones.
- Every table has RLS enabled. Data must not be publicly readable.

## Current status

Phase: **0 — foundation + push proof**

Phase 0 is not done until a scheduled server job has delivered a real notification to the phone. Do not begin feature work before that. If iOS push proves unworkable, we need to know now, not in October.

_Update this section at the end of every phase._
